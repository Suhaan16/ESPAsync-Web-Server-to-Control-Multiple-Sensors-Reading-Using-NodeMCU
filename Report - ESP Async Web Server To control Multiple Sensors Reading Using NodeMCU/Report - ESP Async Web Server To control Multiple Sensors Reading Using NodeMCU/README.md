# FYP-Latex
Final Year Project Template in LaTeX for CSE, DSCE.

## Build Instructions
1. Get MikTex (Download and Install First) : https://miktex.org/download

2. Get TexMaker: https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html

Important: When installing TexMaker, choose the option "Install packages on the Fly". This will save the trouble of having to install the many packages present in the Tex File. If for some reason you must install .sty files manually, then refer to this: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2063/how-can-i-manually-install-a-package-on-miktex-windows

After both are downloaded and Installed, Download (or clone) this github repository. 

Open the *FYP_Full.tex* file if you want to see the source for all 11 pages of the template.

If you have already started making the rest of your report In LaTeX and have errors when you try to integrate the front pages from this repository, then use *FYP_First4Pages.tex* and edit that. You can merge your file and the pdf generated by FYP_First4Pages into one file by using any PDF merging application.

## Troubleshooting

- Try to do frequent recompiles of your source file. If you make 10 changes at once it will be difficult to source the error.

- Save your work frequently!

- If you cannot see images in your document, please check the file path.

- If the source file gives you any errors, consider opening up an issue on the github issues tab.
